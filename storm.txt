Need a better collision system, one that isn't super taxing yet also isn't easy to break. Predictive lines were
not great because they were easy to break but I think they were fairly efficient. To make it unbreakable would 
probably make it just as bad if not worse than my current one. I could optimize my current one but I'm not sure
if that would actually be a good idea, or just a waste of time.
