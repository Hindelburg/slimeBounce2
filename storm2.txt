paint whole thing black or whatever.
for each pixal in image
	calculate relative pixel position.
	using this calculate distance from light position.
	bring back light to pixels based off their distance.

Lets try the first way first, it should be easier to code and easier to do the second way once I've done it once.

DOES IT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY, OR COULD I IMPROVE IT?

paint whole thing black or whatever.
somehow loop through based off distance and then stop when reaches out of distance.
